# Attention-Capsule-Routing-for-Pneumonia
<p> In practise, the Convolutional Neural Network technique works incredibly well, but it has certain limitations, primarily due to the architecture's max-pooling component. Max pooling loses important information from the convolutional layer and is unable to encode spatial correlations between features. Capsule Networks are a new type of network that mimics the way the human brain learns by modelling hierarchical relationships in order to understand an image. A capsule is a group of neurons that each activate for different aspects of an item, such as position, colour, and size.  AR CapsNet is an extension of CapsNet that uses an attention module to route between capsules. The proposed attention routing is a fast-forward pass that preserves spatial information.
  
  
  Through the Attention Routing mechanism in Capsule Routing, we are able to achieve accuracy, precision and recall scores of 98.98, 99 and 99 respectively for the Pneumonia identification from Chest X-ray image task. Since only capsules in the same spatial location are compared while implementing attention routing, Attention Routing Capsnet provides a good way to route between capsules. The attention mechanism helps reduce computation time and space drastically by focusing on the required segments in the images. </p>
